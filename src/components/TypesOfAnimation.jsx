    "Animation is the process of creating motion by displaying a sequence of images, known as frames, in rapid succession. Different animation techniques bring stories, characters, and objects to life in unique ways.",
    "2.1 Traditional (Hand-Drawn) Animation -",
    "Definition: A frame-by-frame technique where each drawing is created by hand.",
    "Originally drawn on paper or transparent cels and photographed.",
    "Used in classic Disney movies (Snow White, The Lion King).",
    "Offers a rich, artistic feel but is time-consuming.",
    "2.2 Stop Motion Animation -",
    "Definition: A technique where physical objects are photographed frame by frame and slightly moved between shots to create motion.",
    "Types include Claymation (Wallace & Gromit), Cutout Animation (South Park), and Puppet Animation (The Nightmare Before Christmas).",
    "Requires patience but creates unique, tangible visuals.",
    "2.3 2D Digital Animation -",
    "Definition: A modern version of traditional animation, created using digital tools instead of paper.",
    "Uses software like Adobe Animate and Toon Boom.",
    "More efficient than hand-drawn animation.",
    "Common in modern cartoons and explainer videos.",
    "2.4 3D Animation -",
    "Definition: A technique where characters and environments are designed in three-dimensional space using computer software.",
    "Found in movies (Toy Story), video games, and VR.",
    "Requires software like Blender, Maya, or Cinema 4D.",
    "2.5 Motion Graphics -",
    "Definition: Animation focused on moving text, shapes, and graphics rather than characters or storytelling.",
    "Used in advertising, marketing, and presentations.",
